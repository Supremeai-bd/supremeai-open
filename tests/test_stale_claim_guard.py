"""Pin: both dispatch surfaces carry the STALE-CLAIM advisory (#2100 arc).

Live 2026-10-28: the tower's queue labels lagged live claims on three rows
(#2111, #2123, #2102) - agents picking from the board saw `status:unclaimed`
on rows claimed >=19 minutes earlier, then burned their cycle on atomic-claim
rejection (work_claim GRANT_NEW fails on the second claimer). The loop cannot
fix wrong label DATA (b3dfbbe already excludes bridge-plane states; this is a
different failure: the label value itself is stale), so the loop's honest
mitigation is the advisory carried to the agent at dispatch time, in the two
places the U3 precedent already uses: the envelope's specialist_prompt and the
dispatch print block.

Comment-immune string-presence pin (wiring-pin precedent test_27 /
test_pick_excludes_bridge_states.py AST pin family): reads the loop module's
source and asserts the guard exists exactly twice with its operative tokens.
Dual-mode: runs under both `python3 -m unittest` and `pytest`.
