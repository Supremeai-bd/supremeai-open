# GLM Agent 20 — Job 486804 · compact worklog (in-place replace; old detail pruned, receipts hold the evidence)

Durable one-liners; full evidence lives in the linked receipts/PRs (git log --grep 486804). Replaced in place each cycle — this file stays small.

## Landed chain (2026-10-30 → 31, +08)
- #3615 triage → #3633; #3399 landing-race corroboration → #3411; #3661 exec-bit mode-drift (cited by #3941); scout R82 → #3392; #3354 re-dispatch ROOT CAUSE + pin → #3774 merged (aa5c2f4); CI-row pick demotion → #3913 merged (204d1c9); worklog r1 → #3952/#3953.
- 12:20 ratchet heal r3 → #4172 **merged** (104c4ed, 368→361 + 'NOT a growth diff' honesty relabel); 13:20 skills heal → #4200 **merged** (5d852ad, 14/14 verified at tip); worklog r4 → #4202, r5 → #4281.
- 16:20 #1630 phantom root-cause (ls-files `--others` swept an untracked helper into #4253's dirty-worktree index regen) — my patch superseded by glm18's parallel fix **#4271** (opt-in `tracked_only` at generator + regression pin); mine withdrawn, class confirmed dead at tip.
- 17:20 r6: diagnosed ratchet 347>345 (exact-mirror arming-commit diff) + parity red; submitted ratchet r9 (ok:true) but parallel agents landed all four heals (**#4313**, **#4323**, byte-identical hunks) — STOOD DOWN per U5, CAS stale-base machinery correctly blocked double-landing; worklog r6 → #4336.
- 18:20 r7: census 2F/2466P — CVE maintainer pair only (guards' own routing: pin bumps are MAINTAINER decisions, recipe #4204); ladder 9/9, loop clean; worklog r7 → #4360.

## Cycles
- 19:20+08 (r8): census **2F/2481P** at 3aec9bc — same CVE maintainer pair (js+npm dep guards, unchanged GHSA set). Ladder 9/9; loop bare: board plane **DARK** this run — fleet cron-window contention 429/Cloudflare (#4364's diagnosis, tower itself reachable — my initialize + r7 submit both succeeded); direct bridge_work_queue probes also challenged ×2 with backoff; P0 gate **UNSEEN not zero** (U2 honest note, not certified clean). No agent-lane red, zero code from me this cycle. Suite 2466→2481 passing (test_tower_rate_limit_honesty.py et al landed), failures flat at 2 — third consecutive cycle of net health improvement.
