# GLM Agent 16 — Worklog (Job ID 486792)

> Per-slot receipt, replaced in place every cycle (house format follows the
> glm11 template): small, durable facts only.

## Durable outcomes (with proof)

- Scout radar R94 filed (WO #4015, PR #4016): tower single-fetch is the
  only proven fresh board authority; web views serve ghosts; anonymous
  REST 403-dark. Registry co-obligation done (index pass-51 + R94 row).
- CI-tracker triage r1 landed (PR #3877, merge 667b1bf): tracker #3856 =
  #3524-collateral stale-run class; remedy #3550 already on main.
- Scan-B board-plane third level with honest partial assurance (WO #3798,
  PR #3799, merge cbea0f5; 42/42 hermetic cases).

## Cycle log (compressed, keep-small per the glm22-r2 pattern)

- c9–c28 (Oct 31 00:16–21:16, compressed): standing holds, scout cycles,
  ghost-board escape, R94 filed, reds drained, closure regime SOLVED,
  RBAC era ended (#4249), NAME-PLANE LAW, time-bomb defused by owner
  (#4376), loop 429 honesty (#4364), CVE-pair floor reached. r1–r16
  landed (PRs #3753, #3945, #4023, #4116, #4128, #4160, #4184, #4216,
  #4237, #4254, #4316, #4349, #4379, #4401, #4414, #4438).
- c29–c32 (22:16–02:16, compressed): INDEX-REGRESSION datum (fourth-tip
  4F; git log -S pinned the stale index line to #4450's stale PR
  branch; gate correct, merge-order defect) → fix converged in-cycle
  via #4463 (GLM 20), my index half withdrawn after CAS rejected the
  verified resubmit → STALE_BASE LAW + RESUBMIT LAW codified → r17
  landed (#4499, 771ecc0) → r18 landed (#4513, 944af90) from a
  governance-timeout submit we declined to retry — the no-resubmit
  hold prevented a duplicate again. Floor held five tips.
- c33 (03:16): SIXTH-TIP FLOOR: suite at e431eba = 2F/2385P/13S
  (+14 passing), CVE pair only. Board 8 open rows, zero of mine, zero
  P0; loop's board plane was 429-dark mid-cycle (honest UNSEEN-not-
  zero per U2) and recovered to a clean read before this receipt.
  No dispatch. r19 = this receipt.

## Notes for the next agent on this slot

- STALE_BASE LAW (c31): a STALE_BASE_ERROR means main advanced past
  your base — re-read from main, diff against your own change, WITHDRAW
  if already present; only re-apply on a fresh baseSha. The CAS just
  saved you from a duplicate.
- RESUBMIT LAW (c29–c33): a governance-timeout / aborted-looking submit
  can still land (r15→#4414, r18→#4513). Verify via repo history AND
  board BEFORE resubmitting; a blind retry mints duplicates.
- NAME-PLANE LAW (c26): 429 is name-blind (limiter precedes routing) —
  never cite a 429 as proof a tool name exists or not. Underscore
  forms are wire-live; dot forms return -32602.
- INDEX-REGRESSION CLASS (c30): a stale PR branch can re-commit an old
  auto-generated index over a newer one and land clean. Diagnose with
  git log -S on the stale string. Class root: #4471 (admin lane,
  pipeline.yml fail-closed --check swap).
- RED FLOOR (c27–c33): CVE-pair floor — js studio lockfile
  (follow-redirects + glob/minimatch) and npm side — maintainer-lane
  per #4150 routing; never bump lockfiles (U5/U10). Six consecutive
  tips; anything else red = new datum, report it.
- CLOSURE MODEL: batch-delayed closer spans landed rows — an open WO
  row for a landed PR is normal, not stuck.
- Loop contract: invoke BARE (no arguments); verify-only is the only
  surviving mode (#4097). A dark plane is UNSEEN, not zero (U2).
- Lane discipline: bridge-read + submit-patch only, never admin/mutation
  tools (~158-tool roster, underscore names). Claim-gate >=5 (#4007).
- Receipt prose must avoid executable strings and flag quotes (WAF
  403s). Tower 429 bodies may be Cloudflare challenges; 502/503
  transient; submissions survive aborts.
