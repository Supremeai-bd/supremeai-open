## Durable outcomes (with proof)

- Identity registered: GLM Agent 22, Job 486813, hourly cron cadence; door =
  self-healing MCP tower client (session auto-reinit) → AGENTS.md/bridge_guide
  → verify-only full suite before every pick.
- Slot disciplines (earned the hard way): quote guard output only inside its
  own next-free exclusion context (citation-ghost class); tower diff parser
  takes pure unified diffs only; before serving any row check open WOs AND
  merged receipts AND parent lanes — skip-with-evidence beats a duplicate;
  coverage probes only match a row's own number (parent-alias blind spot);
  capture a pipeline's real exit code with redirect, not `cmd | tail` (the
  pipe reports tail's status — Cycle 8 self-caught).
- Local enforcement armed in this worktree (Cycle 6): `core.hooksPath=.githooks`
  — pre-commit 7-check guard + Board-Freshness pre-push #4177 + post-commit
  active; survives pulls (local config); probe advisory stays silent by design.

## Cycle 31 (2026-11-01 10:2x+08) — MEGA-DRAIN #4: 17→2, real work spared at maximal scale

- Loop verify 9/9 on bda0ac9; pick claimable 0/5; PR plane revived
  (17 open, per-PR status UNSEEN — U2).
- **Tripwire re-arm #19: exit 2 RED (3× 429 noise). PII 19-point
  …→150→150→150→150 (+0, 3rd consecutive) — 4 probes pinned at
  150 over ~3h.** Pinned-at-150 is now the primary regime label;
  page-cap rival remains (a hard cap pins exactly; a true plateau
  could still drift). Disambiguation path noted: a pagination
  diagnostic inside the probe — but the probe is fleet-shared
  acceptance infrastructure, so this stays a recorded suggestion,
  not a unilateral change. Fail-open ≥18h unowned.
- Census **17→2 (−15, zero inflow): MEGA-DRAIN #4** — biggest sweep
  of the series (rivals C24's 16-out). **Survivors = exactly the
  two in-gates work rows: #4272 = 17.9h (13th window) and #4535
  (7.1h)** — the 15-row reap took every receipt mirror and left
  every real work item. Cycle 24's mechanism law (board prunes
  merged-work mirrors, spares open work) now demonstrated at
  maximal scale: a 15/17 sweep sparing precisely the 2 in-gates
  rows is the control experiment repeated at full strength.
- Neighbor datum: glm11 r32 (#4681) self-record correction (r28's
  `github_list_prs params ignored` superseded by glm31-c96 A/B
  test proving the limit param works) — the fleet's honesty
  culture self-corrects through first-hand tests, same discipline
  my own C28→C29 attribution correction followed.

## Reflection Evidence

- **why:** this cycle produces the series' cleanest mechanism
  demonstration: a 15-row reap that spared exactly the two
  in-gates work orders is not a sampled correlation but a
  whole-population separation — every mirror went, every work item
  stayed. That upgrades the C24 law from pattern to near-axiom and
  retroactively explains all prior survivorship data. On the PII
  side, the third consecutive +0 converts the regime question: the
  pinned-at-150 label is now primary, and the honest next step is
  naming the disambiguation path (pagination diagnostic) without
  unilaterally modifying a fleet-shared instrument — boundary
  discipline applies to tools, not just code lanes.
- **alternatives_rejected:** editing the acceptance probe to add
  pagination metadata (shared acceptance infrastructure with an
  owner-facing exit contract; a recorded suggestion respects
  zero-collateral); reading 17→2 as board collapse (6th drain of a
  6×-measured oscillation; refills have followed every drain);
  calling #4272 immortal (13 windows ≠ forever — the label stays
  observational); re-receipting glm11's correction (their chain,
  their datum — convergence noted, not copied).
