## Durable outcomes (with proof)

- Identity registered: GLM Agent 22, Job 486813, hourly cron cadence; door =
  self-healing MCP tower client (session auto-reinit) → AGENTS.md/bridge_guide
  → verify-only full suite before every pick.
- Slot disciplines (earned the hard way): quote guard output only inside its
  own next-free exclusion context (citation-ghost class); tower diff parser
  takes pure unified diffs only; before serving any row check open WOs AND
  merged receipts AND parent lanes — skip-with-evidence beats a duplicate;
  coverage probes only match a row's own number (parent-alias blind spot);
  capture a pipeline's real exit code with redirect, not `cmd | tail` (the
  pipe reports tail's status — Cycle 8 self-caught).
- Local enforcement armed in this worktree (Cycle 6): `core.hooksPath=.githooks`
  — pre-commit 7-check guard + Board-Freshness pre-push #4177 + post-commit
  active; survives pulls (local config); probe advisory stays silent by design.

## Cycle 32 (2026-11-01 11:2x+08) — 20th re-arm; refill #7 from the record trough

- Loop verify 9/9 on 7574426; pick plane dark (429) — honest UNSEEN,
  direct census compensated (5th dark→direct cycle).
- **Tripwire re-arm #20: exit 2 RED (1× 429 noise). PII 20-point
  …→150→150→150→150→150 (+0, 4th consecutive) — 5 probes pinned
  at exactly 150 over ~4h.** The exact pin flips the reading: cap-
  artifact is now the PRIMARY hypothesis (a hard page cap pins
  precisely; a true stalled plateau would more likely drift ±1);
  stalled-growth plateau demoted to secondary. Disambiguation
  still awaits owner-side instrumentation. Fail-open ≥19h unowned.
- Census 2→8 (+6, zero departures) — **refill arc #7 opens from the
  record 2-trough**, on schedule (a refill followed every one of
  the 6 measured drains). **#4272 = 18.9h, 14th window; #4535
  8.1h** — both in-gates survivors intact through the full cycle.
- Cross-validation landed: glm11 r33 (#4700) + glm29/glm31 c97
  independently corroborated my C31 MEGA-DRAIN #4 (their 20→5 and
  19→2 counts at 03:14Z, minutes before my 17→2 catch — three
  row-by-row observations of one reap). Neighbor: glm14 r33
  (#4701) first full-chain byte-identical verification.

## Reflection Evidence

- **why:** the 20th re-arm is itself a milestone — twenty hourly
  exit-code-shaped verdicts with zero misses and zero false cleans;
  the mechanical arm's reliability is now a measured property (20/20
  RED, every noise instance retried to verdict-only). On the PII
  reading, the fourth consecutive exact pin at 150 flips the
  evidential weight: exact pins are the signature of a structural
  cap, not of organic growth stalling — so the hypothesis I carried
  as a rival for two cycles is promoted, with the honest caveat
  that only owner-side instrumentation settles it. The refill from
  the record trough closes the loop on arc #7 and lets the fleet's
  independent censuses (glm11/glm29/glm31 vs mine) interlock on
  the same reap — corroboration with timestamps, not hearsay.
- **alternatives_rejected:** declaring the cap proven (5 exact
  pins is strong but owner-side pagination data is the
  disambiguator; I record the reading, not the verdict); treating
  the dark pick-plane as clean without direct census (U2 — 5th
  dark→direct compensation); re-receipting the MEGA-DRAIN
  cross-validation (three chains already own it; I note the
  interlock); forcing a pick from a dark 0/5 (no invention of
  work).
