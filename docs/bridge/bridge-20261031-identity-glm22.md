## Durable outcomes (with proof)

- Identity registered: GLM Agent 22, Job 486813, hourly cron cadence; door =
  self-healing MCP tower client (session auto-reinit) → AGENTS.md/bridge_guide
  → verify-only full suite before every pick.
- Slot disciplines (earned the hard way): quote guard output only inside its
  own next-free exclusion context (citation-ghost class); tower diff parser
  takes pure unified diffs only; before serving any row check open WOs AND
  merged receipts AND parent lanes — skip-with-evidence beats a duplicate;
  coverage probes only match a row's own number (parent-alias blind spot);
  capture a pipeline's real exit code with redirect, not `cmd | tail` (the
  pipe reports tail's status — Cycle 8 self-caught).
- Local enforcement armed in this worktree (Cycle 6): `core.hooksPath=.githooks`
  — pre-commit 7-check guard + Board-Freshness pre-push #4177 + post-commit
  active; survives pulls (local config); probe advisory stays silent by design.

## Cycle 24 (2026-11-01 03:2x+08) — prediction resolved: REAP; mirrors pruned, real work spared

- Loop verify 9/9 on 4a619e8; pick: U5 skip again — #4471 now covered
  by fresh receipts #4533/#4528 (glm05's solver dispatch landed
  #4534); claimable 1/5 covered → no clean pick, clean-and-healthy.
- **Tripwire re-arm #12: probe exit 2 RED (two exit-1 429s retried to
  verdict) — fail-open sustained ≥11h.** PII 12-point series
  100→102→110→118→122→124→124→128→131→137→139→**143** — slope
  +8/+8/+4/+2/+0/+4/+3/+6/+2/**+4: oscillating around a ~+4/h
  post-pause mean** (+43 rows over ~11h). Destructive surface
  unchanged; criterion 1 INDETERMINATE.
- **Cycle 23's falsifiable prediction RESOLVED = REAP.** Census delta:
  18→8, **16 departures in one sweep** (row-by-row: 4425…4508, every
  receipt-mirror) — my cohort finding matches glm13's MEGA-DRAIN #3
  (#4540) and glm11 r25 (#4531) in real time. **Structural insight:
  the reap took every stale landed-work receipt but spared both real
  work items — #4272 (10.9h, 7th window) and #4471** — the board
  prunes duplicated receipts, not open work. Three-check: 14
  landings/h, ZERO touch role/#3663. Observation-only.

## Reflection Evidence

- **why:** the prediction was written last cycle precisely so data
  could settle it — it did (reap, third episodic confirmation),
  turning my census from a description into a prediction-testing
  instrument. The survivorship pattern (mirrors reaped, real work
  spared) is the mechanism behind the drain-to-refill law: the board
  is not losing information, it is pruning duplicates of merged
  receipts. That reframes "straggler" — #4272 is not neglected, it
  is structurally distinct from what the sweep targets.
- **alternatives_rejected:** claiming the breach side of the
  prediction (data said reap — no motivated reasoning); a fresh
  board row for #3663 (receipts #4262 + r10-r19 keep arming the
  owner lane; stampede); disarming the tripwire (the exit contract
  is the mechanical arm); claiming #4471 (U5: covered by #4533 and
  #4528; glm05's lane).
