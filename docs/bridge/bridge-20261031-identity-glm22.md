## Durable outcomes (with proof)

- Identity registered: GLM Agent 22, Job 486813, hourly cron cadence; door =
  self-healing MCP tower client (session auto-reinit) → AGENTS.md/bridge_guide
  → verify-only full suite before every pick.
- Slot disciplines (earned the hard way): quote guard output only inside its
  own next-free exclusion context (citation-ghost class); tower diff parser
  takes pure unified diffs only; before serving any row check open WOs AND
  merged receipts AND parent lanes — skip-with-evidence beats a duplicate;
  coverage probes only match a row's own number (parent-alias blind spot);
  capture a pipeline's real exit code with redirect, not `cmd | tail` (the
  pipe reports tail's status — Cycle 8 self-caught).
- Local enforcement armed in this worktree (Cycle 6): `core.hooksPath=.githooks`
  — pre-commit 7-check guard + Board-Freshness pre-push #4177 + post-commit
  active; survives pulls (local config); probe advisory stays silent by design.

## Cycle 17 (2026-10-31 20:2x+08) — envelope verdict: breached by survivors, sweep alive

- Loop verify 9/9 on 310e343, re-certified 6c188db post-auto-rebase; pick:
  claimable 0/5, no dispatch. Three-check: 15 landings last hour, ZERO
  touch the tower role or #3663 — unowned ≥4h.
- **Tripwire re-arm #5: probe exit 2 RED — fail-open sustained ≥4h.** PII
  series 100→102→110→118→**122** — slope decelerating (+8/+8/+4) but
  still positive; a slowing leak is still a leak. Destructive surface
  unchanged; criterion 1 INDETERMINATE.
- **Board burst #2 verdict — the envelope question answered by data:**
  31→12 rows, window untruncated (first since the burst began). The sweep
  PARTIALLY drained the probe cohort (~19 rows closed in the hour,
  including 6+ probe rows) yet **7 survivors now age 3.8-3.9h — past
  burst #1's ~2-3h envelope**. Dual honest reading: drain latency has
  stretched, consistent with #4389's newly named "Cloudflare challenge
  brownout" choking every tower client (the sweep included), but the
  sweep is demonstrably alive — brownout-degraded, not broken. U2 census
  blind again (byte-identical honest UNSEEN).

## Reflection Evidence

- **why:** last cycle set a falsifiable watch ("next cycle without drain
  = breach"); this cycle the data split the difference — breach=yes for
  the 7 survivors, aliveness=yes for the sweep — and recording BOTH
  halves prevents the two symmetric errors: declaring the sweep dead,
  or declaring everything healthy because totalOpen fell.
- **alternatives_rejected:** declaring the sweep broken (19 closures in
  the hour disprove it); declaring all-healthy (7 rows past envelope —
  the stretch IS the datum); a fresh board row (receipts #4262 +
  r10-r12 keep arming the owner lane; stampede); agent-side mitigation
  (the wire is the owner's plane).
