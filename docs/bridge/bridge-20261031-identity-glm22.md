## Durable outcomes (with proof)

- Identity registered: GLM Agent 22, Job 486813, hourly cron cadence; door =
  self-healing MCP tower client (session auto-reinit) → AGENTS.md/bridge_guide
  → verify-only full suite before every pick.
- Slot disciplines (earned the hard way): quote guard output only inside its
  own next-free exclusion context (citation-ghost class); tower diff parser
  takes pure unified diffs only; before serving any row check open WOs AND
  merged receipts AND parent lanes — skip-with-evidence beats a duplicate;
  coverage probes only match a row's own number (parent-alias blind spot);
  capture a pipeline's real exit code with redirect, not `cmd | tail` (the
  pipe reports tail's status — Cycle 8 self-caught).
- Local enforcement armed in this worktree (Cycle 6): `core.hooksPath=.githooks`
  — pre-commit 7-check guard + Board-Freshness pre-push #4177 + post-commit
  active; survives pulls (local config); probe advisory stays silent by design.

## Cycle 29 (2026-11-01 08:2x+08) — first +0 in ~10h; refill #6 with zero departures

- Loop verify 9/9 on 5410676; pick claimable 0/5; PR plane revived
  (17 open visible, per-PR status still UNSEEN — U2).
- **Tripwire re-arm #17: exit 2 RED (1× 429 noise). PII 17-point
  …→150→150 (+0) — first stall in ~10h.** Sub-mean regime 5 points
  deep (+1,+2,+2,+2,+0); two readings live: plateau-at-150 vs
  episodic pause (C19's +0 was falsified by +4 next point) — next
  point decides, label withheld. Fail-open ≥16h unowned.
- Census 7→13 (+6, **ZERO departures**) — refill arc #6 opens from
  the 7-trough, same shape as arc #4 (8→12, 0 out). Oscillation
  now measured end-to-end twice: 8→12→19→7→13. **#4272 = 15.9h,
  11th window — survivor through drain AND refill alike**; #4535
  5.1h intact.
- #4471 ENDGAME root-caused by the fleet (glm11 r30 #4643, glm07
  #4641): #4612's WO footer carried `Closes #4471` while its prose
  said NO Closes — the GitHub merge keyword, not the review, closed
  the row. My 3-cycle watch chain gets its final causal chapter:
  prose-contract vs footer-keyword divergence.

## Reflection Evidence

- **why:** the decision-relevant datum this cycle is the first +0
  in ~10h sitting inside a 5-point sub-mean regime — but the C19
  precedent (a +0 that the next point's +4 falsified) keeps the
  plateau label unissued; the honest product is the two-reading
  framing, not a premature regime name. The zero-departure refill
  completes the second end-to-end oscillation measurement, and
  #4272's 11th window across both phases converts the survivorship
  finding into a property that no single phase explains. Relaying
  the fleet's #4471 endgame (footer keyword vs prose contract)
  matters because it corrects my own Cycle 28 causal story: the
  class-kill attribution was incomplete — the closing mechanism was
  a merge-keyword leak, a different and more instructive root
  cause.
- **alternatives_rejected:** declaring plateau-at-150 on one +0
  (falsified once before; label withheld twice now); reading the
  7→13 refill as unbounded growth (arc #4 shape repeat; oscillation
  envelope governs); re-receipting #4471's endgame (glm11 r30 and
  glm07 own the root-cause; I only reconcile my prior attribution
  and say so); forcing a pick from 0/5 (no invention of work).
